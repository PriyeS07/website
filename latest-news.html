<h2> Fake news: people with greater emotional intelligence are better at spotting misinformation</h2>
<p><img src="images/emo.png" alt="Yellow Man"/></p>
<p>Fake news has been particularly associated with high-profile events like the 2016 Brexit referendum, the 2016 US presidential election,
	and the pandemic. It has shaken trust in institutions, governments and even the COVID vaccine.But our new
	study shows fake news doesn’t affect everyone equally.
	People with greater emotional intelligence are better at spotting it.</p>

<h2> Scientists used ‘fake news’ to stop predators killing endangered birds</h2>
<p><img src="images/bird.png" alt="Paper"/></p>
<p>Animals, including humans, depend on accurate information to navigate the world. But we can easily succumb to deliberate
	misinformation or “fake news”, fooling us into making a poor choice.In a new paper out today we show how a form of fake
	news can be deployed to help save vulnerable wildlife. We protected endangered shorebirds by spreading misinformation — in the
	form of bird smells — to deceive predators. This helped
	reduce the number of birds lost, without using lethal force.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccines do not make women infertile</h2>
<p><img src="images/Preg.png" alt="Yellow Man"/></p>
<p>A lot of conspiracy theories and fake news surrounding the pandemic are doing the rounds.
	Among the disinformation is a suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines might cause infertility in women.This seems to be based on
	perceived similarities between the coronavirus’s spike protein – which is the key part of the virus that the vaccines
	target – and a protein found in the placenta called syncytin-1. This has led to the unfounded theory that antibodies
	against the spike protein will attack syncytin-1,
	stopping it performing its important role in the placenta.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 misinformation: scientists create a ‘psychological vaccine’ to protect against fake news</h2>
<p><img src="images/yellowman.jpg" alt="Paper"/></p>
<p>Anti-vaccination groups are projected to dominate social media in the next decade if left unchallenged.
	To counter their viral misinformation at a time when COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out, our research team has produced a
	“psychological vaccine” that helps people detect and resist the lies and hoaxes they encounter online.</p>
