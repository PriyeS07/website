<h2>What is fake news?</h2>
<p>“Fake news” is a term that has come to mean different things to different people. At its core, we are defining “fake news”
	as those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes.
	Sometimes these stories may be propaganda that is intentionally designed to mislead the reader, or may be designed as “clickbait”
	written for economic incentives (the writer profits on the number of people who click on the story). In recent years, fake news stories
	have proliferated
	via social media, in part because they are so easily and quickly shared online.</p>

<h2>How to spot Fake News</h2>
	<h3>1. Check the source</h3>
	<p>Look at the website where the story comes from. Does it look real? Is the text well written? Are there a variety of other stories or is it just one story? Fake news websites often use addresses that sound like real newspapers, but don't have many real stories about other topics. If you aren't sure, click on the 'About' page and look for a clear description of the organisation.</p>

	<h3>2. Watch out for fake photos</h3>
	<p>Many fake news stories use images that are Photoshopped or taken from an unrelated site. Sometimes, if you just look closely at an image, you can see if it has been changed. Or use a tool like Google Reverse Image search. It will show you if the same image has been used in other contexts.</p>

	<h3>3. Check the story is in other places</h3>
	<p>Look to see if the story you are reading is on other news sites that you know and trust. If you do find it on many other sites, then it probably isn't fake (although there are some exceptions), as many big news organisations try to check their sources before they publish a story.</p>

	<h3>4. Look for other signs</h3>
	<p>There are other techniques that fake news uses. These include using ALL CAPS and lots of ads that pop up when you click on a link. Also, think about how the story makes you feel. If the news story makes you angry, it's probably designed to make you angry.</p>

	<p>If you know these things about online news, and can apply them in your everyday life, then you have the control over what to read, what to believe and most importantly what to share. If you find a news story that you know is fake, the most important advice is: don't share it!</p>
